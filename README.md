A homework demo using JavaScript to generate a random password.

## Project Summary
This homework demonstration required the use of javascript to create a working application to generate a random password with the user selected criteria.

### Result
The functioning application demonstrates what happens when the user clicks the 'Generate Password' button. Once the button is clicked the user is prompted with a series of questions. The prompts collect information to then output a password generated using random characters including only the character types the user selected, along with the amount of characters selected.
